Select signals from the Q&A section section. So what's the analyst sentiment? So when they're asking their questions, how negative or positive they are? That seems to be pretty indicative. You know the the general. Corporate ones kind of work, but it's mostly the change one. So if analysts become more negative, then that's pretty useful. Or I think that even the CEO one change over the year is also useful. And today, will we be interested in talking to you? Is that we're we're getting at the topic modeling, and so that is where we're actually tagging different sentences. In the transcript on what topics they are related to. So you could say in our case, really, for DLC would be are they talking about debt paydown? So the degree of that occurring in the transcripts? Or in other filings or whatnot, but also the sentiment related to that. So what are they talking about? Debt paydown is a positive way, or a negative way, and to that provides a signals. So, debt paydown tomorrow you could also think like M&A is like obviously a topic and transcripts sometimes. No hate dividend policy or share repurchase policy. But you know, I think you're probably even better expert than I am on all the different types of categories that we'd be interested in exploring. I think MJ has like 10 of them, so maybe I'm ju just show the different and we we kind of source these from the CFA institute's like they have. I mean, we just pulled because they what we need. We need text because we need text that we can use that will, especially our correlation. So what's the correlation between this text and the senses? And so that tells us, you know if it's really related, then they're talking about that topic. You know what? Before we get off with this. I'm not the just don't know what your ship bringing up. It's really interesting to me that that's not what you're what you're finding from endless sentiment is more powerful than the CEO sentiment and just two things. I'll become my head now that might be might be helpful. Just talking out there and throw it away if it's not helpful, but if there's a. And and management, if they say divergent in that sentiment. But I don't know if he's looking at analyst sentiment, standalone or or. Just comparing it to the the management as well. But you know, man was always gonna be the dog. Gonna be positive, right? Yeah it was all of a sudden bring it back to somewhere to where they really want to focus. That's always instructed, right?
